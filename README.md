# Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nano-degree

## Project 1: SQL Part 
[Check the project details by clicking on this link.](https://github.com/MohammadAbdullahA/Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python-/tree/master/SQL%20Project)
### Overview:
In this project, I used SQL to explore the Sakila movie database. After the exploration phase, I had to visualize each of my findings using a PowerPoint presentation and provide a brief explanation along with each finding.Â The presentation was broken down as follows:
- A question of interest.
- A supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
- A supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.

## Project 2: Python Part

### Overview:
In this project, I used Python to explore the data related to the bike share system in three major cities in the United States, which are:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington

Basically, I wrote a code to import the data from CSV files and answered interesting questions about the dataset by computing descriptive statistics. In addition, I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience and made sure that the program is case-insensitive.

## Project 3: Version Control Part

### Overview:
In this project, I posted the Python part on GitHub for refactoring purposes. This was done by forking an existing remote repository and then cloning it into my local repository. Finally, I followed the guidelines given by Udacity to document and push the changes into the forked remote repository.
