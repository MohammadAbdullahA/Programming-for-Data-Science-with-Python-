## Project Title: Explore US Bikeshare Data

 
## Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Files used
1. The following file contains the code written:
- Bikeshare.py
2. The following files contains the dataset:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

However, these files are placed in the .gitignore due their large size.
